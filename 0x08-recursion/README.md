This project teaches the process by which a function call itself directly or indirectly.

The project code is 0x08. C - Recursion in the ALX-low-levele-programming.

There is a total of 9 task in the project and each task helps to shed more light on how recursion works.

A Recursive functions solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller, simpler instances of the same problem, therefore making it easy to reach the base case which is the condtion that terminates the recursion.
