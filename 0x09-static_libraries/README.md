This project is on 0x09. C - Static libraries. 

It aims to introduce learners to a static library that provides a convenient way to reuse code across multiple programs without having to recomplie the library code each time.

They are statically linked into the program, meaning the library code becomes a part of the executable binary.

It contains functions, data structures, and other reusable code that can be used by multiple programs.
